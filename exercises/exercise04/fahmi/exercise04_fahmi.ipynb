We will vote on the best (and worst) in each category, and the winner gets a small (tasty) prize.\n","\n","Please find an example of a data visualization that is either _very effective_ or _terribly ineffective_ in communicating an interesting finding from data. Here are a few ground rules:\n","- One figure only: We should be able to see the whole thing at once on a projector screen.\n","- Static images only: If you find something dynamic or interactive that you _must_ submit, please take a screenshot.\n","- Do the reading first: Tufte will give you some ideas for what makes visualizations good or bad\n","- No examples from Tufte. Gotta work a little bit.\n","\n","Please either paste a link to your image in the text cell below (can you figure out how to get markdown to display the image?) or add an image file to your PR.\n","- Please label it clearly as \"good\" or \"bad\" so we know which race you're in.\n","- Please write a couple bullets about why it's good or bad.

(Remember to include it in your PR.) My cursory search found data as late as 2022.\n","\n","## New instructions for submitting a PR with multiple files\n","\n","Because you'll be working with multiple files, PRs become _slightly_ more complicated, so we're graduating to a new 'mini-repository' pattern:\n","- Make a new folder in `exercises/exercise04` with your last name (just like the suffix for your notebook file)\n","- Upload your notebook file, also appropriately named, into that folder\n","- Upload any other files you make/use, including `.py` and `.csv` files, into that folder, so everything is together in the same place\n","\n","Ultimately, this will look a bit like this:\n","```\n","── exercises\n","    ├── exercise04\n","        ├── harvey\n","            ├── exercise04_harvey.ipynb\n","            ├── affordable_housing_calcs.py\n","            ├── affordable_housing.csv\n","            └── wards_from_2022.csv\n","```\n","\n","**NOTE:** Yes, I realize this is a bit redundant because everyone will have copies of the same CSV files. This would never be a good idea for production coding--we would have one `data` directory, and everyone would draw from the same data. However, there are two reasons for all these copies in this case:\n","1. It's good practice to build a repository with all the parts your code needs to run.\n","    - In later weeks, when you  _don't_ all have the same data, it won't seem as redundant.\n","3. Having everything in one folder will make it easy for me to run your code on my computer.\n","\n","## Hints\n","- You may want to join the population data _after_ summarizing the affordable housing data (i.e., join populations to sums of units). However, I could also see an approach where you join at the beginning, then aggregate the population column with a method called `first`\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":42,"id":"270729b1-57eb-429e-92e4-2320838f2415","metadata":{"id":"270729b1-57eb-429e-92e4-2320838f2415","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":75},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709593615219,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":873,"user":{"displayName":"Khairun Fahmi","userId":"18038988219970526618"}},"outputId":"7ee443ef-937c-496f-ea81-90a2cc7744b1"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/Excercise04_Fahmi'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":42}],"source":["# Import your module\n","import pandas as pd\n","import os\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","\n","os.getcwd()\n","# Call your main function"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["os.chdir('/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Excercise04_Fahmi')"],"metadata":{"id":"asmpsL3cpr7L","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709593617480,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":117,"user":{"displayName":"Khairun Fahmi","userId":"18038988219970526618"}}},"id":"asmpsL3cpr7L","execution_count":43,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import housingcal"],"metadata":{"id":"cgtLZon6mAlZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709593619030,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":138,"user":{"displayName":"Khairun Fahmi","userId":"18038988219970526618"}}},"id":"cgtLZon6mAlZ","execution_count":44,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["affordable_housing_proportion()\n","# this last code calling the function is not running"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":204},"id":"EESURaZkq0Zl","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1709593806019,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":154,"user":{"displayName":"Khairun Fahmi","userId":"18038988219970526618"}},"outputId":"713bd6a6-6764-495c-925c-e2eeee001558"},"id":"EESURaZkq0Zl","execution_count":55,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"NameError","evalue":"name 'affordable_housing_proportion' is not defined","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m                                 Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-55-85fe120f2d3e>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<cell line: 1>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 1\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0maffordable_housing_proportion\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m      2\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m# this last code calling the function is not running\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m: name 'affordable_housing_proportion' is not defined"]}]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.12"},"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"https://github.com/ncsg/ursp688y_sp2024/blob/main/exercises/exercise04/exercise04.ipynb","timestamp":1708980716934}]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
