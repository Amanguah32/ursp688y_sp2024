    "\n",
    "In prep for next week, part of your exercise is to find an example of either an _excellent_ or _terrible_ data visualization. We will vote on the best (and worst) in each category, and the winner gets a small (tasty) prize.\n",

    "Please find an example of a data visualization that is either _very effective_ or _terribly ineffective_ in communicating an interesting finding from data. Here are a few ground rules:\n",
    "- One figure only: We should be able to see the whole thing at once on a projector screen.\n",
    "- Static images only: If you find something dynamic or interactive that you _must_ submit, please take a screenshot.\n",

    "# The Programming Part\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Exercise 3](https://github.com/ncsg/ursp688y_sp2024/blob/main/exercises/exercise03/exercise03.ipynb), you examined how many affordable housing units available to households up to 60% AMI were planned within each ward in Washington, D.C.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bonus problem was to calculate which wards were producing a _disproportionately_ large and small number of housing units given their populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, please reproduce this analysis, <ins>including</ins> the bonus part, using some of your new data loading, joining, and module-building skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please write a program that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loads the affordable housing project data from `affordable_housing.csv`\n",
    "- Loads the ward populations from `wards_from_2022.csv`\n",
    "- Joins the population data to the affordable housing data\n",
    "- Calculates which wards are producing disproportionately large and small number of housing units given their populations\n",
    "- Completes all of this data loading and processing within a function (or a series of functions called by a single main function)\n",
    "- Stores that function (and any related functions) in a module\n",
    "- Calls the main function in the exercise notebook to return table or other summary or results\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "CSVs for both required data tables are included on GitHub at `exercises/exercise04`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please consult the city's database of [affordable housing](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::affordable-housing/about) projects and [ward demographic](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::wards-from-2022/about) data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus: find, download, and use more recent ward population data. (Remember to include it in your PR.) My cursory search found data as late as 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "## New instructions for submitting a PR with multiple files\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you'll be working with multiple files, PRs become _slightly_ more complicated, so we're graduating to a new 'mini-repository' pattern:\n",
    "- Make a new folder in `exercises/exercise04` with your last name (just like the suffix for your notebook file)\n",
    "- Upload your notebook file, also appropriately named, into that folder\n",
    "- Upload any other files you make/use, including `.py` and `.csv` files, into that folder, so everything is together in the same place\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this will look a bit like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "── exercises\n",
    "    ├── exercise04\n",
    "        ├── harvey\n",
    "            ├── exercise04_harvey.ipynb\n",
    "            ├── affordable_housing_calcs.py\n",
    "            ├── affordable_housing.csv\n",
    "            └── wards_from_2022.csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Yes, I realize this is a bit redundant because everyone will have copies of the same CSV files. This would never be a good idea for production coding--we would have one `data` directory, and everyone would draw from the same data. However, there are two reasons for all these copies in this case:\n",
    "1. It's good practice to build a repository with all the parts your code needs to run.\n",
    "    - In later weeks, when you  _don't_ all have the same data, it won't seem as redundant.\n",
    "3. Having everything in one folder will make it easy for me to run your code on my computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints\n",
    "- You may want to join the population data _after_ summarizing the affordable housing data (i.e., join populations to sums of units). However, I could also see an approach where you join at the beginning, then aggregate the population column with a method called `first`\n",
