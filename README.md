## Course Description

Novel data and computational tools are reshaping planning, development, operation, and understanding of urban systems. These may enable more efficient and equitable distribution of resources, but may also reproduce injustices and divert attention away from more straightforward solutions. This course will introduce students to basic tools and applications for data science to examine urban systems while also challenging them to critique the role of technology in improving cities. What are data science's strengths and weaknesses? Where does it belong (or not) in our planning toolkits? How have planners and technologists appropriately espoused the capabilities of data science and smart cities? And how have these technologies failed to live up to their advertised capabilities? What questions can big data answer, and what issues does it raise? These overarching questions will guide parallel technical and theoretical threads throughout the semester.

The technical thread will use coding demos and short exercises to introduce students to programming logic and Python for urban data science. Demos will be aimed at beginners: students who have never coded before. Exercises will give beginners an opportunity to practice new skills, and more advanced coders an opportunity to stretch their capabilities in urban applications they may not have previously encountered.

The theoretical thread will use reading seminars to examinine the emergence, capabilities, and limitations of smart cities, big data, and urban data science.

The threads will converge on a final project that asks students to design a data scientific approach to address a contemporary planning issue and critique its capabilities and limitations. Students may either implement their project in code or write a detailed proposal for it.

This course will prepare you to:

1. Use programming logic to address analytical questions, and a Python-based toolkit to implement analyses and share them reproducibly with others
2. Understand the technical and ethical limitations of digital technologies in urban contexts
3. Be professionally conversant with urban technologies, either as a coder or someone who is able to collaborate in design, implementation, and interpretation of urban analyses

## Components

### Coding Demos

Each class will include an interactive coding demo, which I will walk through while answering questions and providing additional context on tools, techniques, related theory, and applications in planning. Demo notebooks will be provided for you to run on your own, either during or after class. But I will also present other content ad-hoc, so attending the demos will be essential. They will introduce the basic tools you need for each exercise.

Demos will have some planning and structure, but they will also be a time to roll up our sleeves, experiment, program collaboratively, and Google for help together. They will show how programming is sometimes (or often) messy and frustrating, but with a little grit and ingenuity you can usually find a solution. They will be a welcoming place for beginner coders to embrace uncertainty, ask what might feel like dumb questions, and recognize that everyone else is probably facing the same problems.

### Reading Seminars

The other main component of each class will be a discussion-based reading seminar. You should read chapters and articles listed on the schedule _before_ each class and be prepared to discuss them. Readings demonstrate the use of urban data science techniques in research and discuss theoretical issues around the use of urban data science and smart cities technologies. They are meant to show both best practices _and_ opportunities for critique and improvement.

Everyone will be assigned to lead discussion for at least one class session. Discussion leaders should be prepared to pose questions to classmates and keep discussion reasonably focused on the topics covered by that day's reading. Leaders should _not_ give a presentation summarizing the reading for that day. The reading load is designed to be manageable so that everyone can be prepared to discuss all readings.

### Exercises (20% of grade)

Short weekly exercises will give you opportunities to try out techniques demonstrated in the coding demos. Each will be structured around a question that you should be able to address using the tools you have learned so-far. You are encouraged to outline solutions with pseudocode. A clear and reasonably detailed approach in pseudocode will get 90% credit, just as much as sloppy code with a clean result.

A "clean result" means that I can rerun your code and arrive at the same number, table, figure, or other final output that you did, and that this output addresses the question posed by the exercise. There will rarely be entirely right or wrong answers.

Exercises will be assigned in each class and are due before the next class.

Each exercise will have a Colab/Jupyter notebook available on the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/ncsg/ursp688y_sp2024) ("repo"). Please this a standard GitHub workflow to submit each exercise (we'll go over this in class):

1. Fork the course GitHub repo to your own account
 (you'll probably only have to do this once at the beginning of the course)
2. Make a copy of the notebook in your own fork with you last name as an underscored suffix
 (e.g., `exercise01_harvey.ipynb`)
3. Complete the exercise in your copy of the notebook
4. Commit your notebook (and any other necessary files) to your fork
5. Make a pull request of your fork to the course repo

Please note that all pull requests to course repo will be publicly viewable.

Exercises will be graded out of 10 points based on this rubric:

- 0: nothing handed in
- 6: sloppy or illogical code or pseudocode; no clean result
- 9: readable and logical code or pseudocode; no clean result
- 9: sloppy code; clean result
- 10: readable and logical code or pseudocode; clean result
- 11: wow

Free pass: There are 11 exercises, but only the 10 best grades will count.

Late submissions will not be accepted.

### Final Project (50% of grade)

The course will culminate with a final project, delivered in three stages—a short proposal (10%), presentation (10%), and final product (30%)—that will give you a chance to practice using data scientific approaches to address a real-world planning problem. You may develop a final project independently or with one partner.

The project asks you to address a request from an imaginary planning agency for analysis of a potential equity gap within their city or region. You get to choose which region you are working for and the question you are asking about equitable outcomes. In designing your analysis and discussing the results, the agency would also like you to consider the theoretical strengths and weaknesses of using data scientific and smart cities approaches to examine equity and address inequities. Can you design an analysis that appropriately balances opportunities and concerns?

Projects may take two forms: (1) a functioning analysis with input data and a codebase that yield reproducible results, or (2) a proposal for an analysis that could reasonably be executed.

### Functional Analysis

You will develop a well-documented repository of data and code, along with a short accompanying narrative describing the project's motivation, central question, approach, results, and discussion of their meaning. The narrative may be either a traditional paper or a customized webpage/site/app that combines text and graphics. Narratives for this option are expected to be approximately 1,500 words (3 pages, single spaced).

### Proposal

You will write a paper with sections similar to the narrative described above, but with considerably more detail about the proposed approach. In lieu of conducting the analysis, you must convincingly portray how it will be conducted (when it is funded, of course), including proposed data sources and tools. The proposal should also include expanded discussion of smart cities theory to support and critique how your approach relates to equity, both in the substantive question it addresses and opportunities or issues it raises methodologically. This will likely draw on literature outside of what is assigned for the course. Narratives for this option are expected to be approximately 6,500 words (12 pages, single spaced).

Convincing proposals are crucial in both research and practice. Imagine you are applying for a grant to fund a research project or responding to an RFP issued by a public agency. In both cases, you need to convince the reader that your approach is actionable. It should also be intelligible for a non-expert audience. Writing with this combination precision and clarity is a valuable skill to hone.

### Participation (30% of grade)

This is a hands-on and discussion-oriented course with only 14 scheduled meeting times. More than one unexcused absence will affect your learning and participation grade. Please email me ahead of class, ideally by at least several hours, to let me know if you will be unable to join due to illness or other excusable reasons listed in the [graduate course-related policies](https://gradschool.umd.edu/course-related-policies). Your participation grade for the semester will reflect both your leading of discussion in an assigned reading seminar (10%) and general engagement with class activities (20%).

## Required Reading

We will read Jennifer Clark's book on smart cities, _Uneven Innovation_, from cover to cover. You may want to buy a hard copy, or you can read the [ebook for free](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/umdcp/reader.action?docID=5763883) through the UMD library. All other readings are either available at links listed in the schedule or will be available on ELMS-Canvas.

## Zoom Guidelines­­­—'Cameras On' Norm

On Zoom, we will have a 'cameras on' norm to promote focus and collegiality. Many of us will have unideal environments or technological hiccups. This is okay. However, please do your best to minimize distractions for you and your classmates.

## Code Readability

A key aspect of writing good code is readability: can you and others quickly and easily understand it? In many cases, code will run (readable to the machine) without being readable for a human. But sloppy, unreadable code won't be as useful for debugging, recycling, and documenting your process. I will do my best to demonstrate readable code in demos and exercise notebooks. You will need to write readable code to get full points on exercises. And you'll be much more appealing as a prospective collaborator or hire if you write readable code.

[CS61A](https://cs61a.org/articles/composition/) has an excellent composition guide. [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) is a standard Python style guide. [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) publishes their internal Python style guide. Any of these, or reasonable variants of them, will help your code look clean, professional, and readable. When in doubt, just try to be consistent and use good judgement.

## Online Resources, Academic Integrity, and Troubleshooting

Coders sometimes feel like professional Googlers. There are a lot of code snippets on sites like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Working collaboratively is extremely useful for ideation and troubleshooting. [This](https://cs61a.org/articles/debugging/) is an excellent debugging guide from CS61A. And generative AIs, like ChatGTP, are an increasingly important tool. One goal of this course is to introduce you to these sources for help and give you practice using rather than abusing them. This is both practical and ethical. You might write workable code simply by copying and pasting snippets from a forum or asking ChatGTP to write you a script. But this is unlikely to yield beautiful, reliable, and efficient code. Part of your job is to use resources intelligently, gut-check sources (is ChatGTP doing what I wanted?), customize examples to your purpose, and be a creative and ethical backstop to the availability of sloppy and poorly credited internet shortcuts.

Here are my suggestions:

- Be a compulsive Googler. Ask ChatGTP what's wrong with your code. Ask your friends, too. Use these resources to learn and make your coding better, not to avoid learning. If I suspect you have merely copied and pasted code for an exercise, I will call you out on it. If I can't tell, good on the AI, but bad for your learning as a coder. Why bother taking this class?
- If you copy and paste a major block of code, cite the source in a comment. I often paste [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) URLs into docstrings for basic functions that I've borrowed or adapted from posts, both to show others where I got them, and remind myself in case I want to go back to the source later. This is both practical and ethical.
- If you're in a Googling death spiral and just can't find an answer, first ask a classmate—there's a good chance you've confronted the same issue—then ask me.
- You are encouraged to work on exercises with a classmate. You're even welcome to submit the same code for exercises. Just note at the top of your submission who you worked with.
